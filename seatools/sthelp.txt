2. Introduction
---------------
Seagate's Customer Service organization strives to be Best In Class in
everything it does. No matter how friendly and efficient we are,
returning a drive for warranty service means system downtime and
inconvenience for you in packing and returning your drive product. Of
the drives returned to Seagate for warranty replacement, a large
percentage are perfectly good drives with "No Problem Found" (NPF)
after testing. Your drive may be completely healthy. Before you send
it in, it is in your best interest to determine if a replacement drive
is really necessary to solve your problem. This troubleshooting
diagnostic utility will help you make that determination and possibly
save you time and money and preserve your data.

    Some typical reasons for NPFs are:

    * File System Corruption
    * Driver Corruption
    * Broken Master Boot Record
    * Virus Attack
    * Hardware Conflicts

=====================================================================

4. Using SeaTools Disc Diagnostic
---------------------------------
 -l  list all attached SCSI disks

 Displays an abbreviated list of devices physically connected to your
 system and provides the /dev/ device names you'll use to select one
 for testing. The bus scan listing gives device, vendor, model,
 firmware rev and number of blocks (sectors, typically 512 bytes
 each).

 The listing may also begin with host adapter information.  For
 example:

 Host adapter information:
 Adaptec AHA274x/284x/294x (EISA/VLB/PCI-Fast SCSI) 5.2.4/5.2.0
        <Adaptec AIC-7899 Ultra 160/m SCSI host adapter>
 Adaptec AHA274x/284x/294x (EISA/VLB/PCI-Fast SCSI) 5.2.4/5.2.0
        <Adaptec AIC-7899 Ultra 160/m SCSI host adapter>

 Drive information:
 /dev/sga SEAGATE  ST39204LC        0006 17921834 blocks
 /dev/sgb SEAGATE  ST318436LW       0010 35885167 blocks

-------------------------------------------------------------
-i  display drive Inquiry information

Display detailed information about a specific device including,
standard inquiry data, drive serial number, as well as firmware and
servo revision information.  In addition, the inquiry screen also
lists the current mode page settings that might be modifiable by the
software.  The following example for a /dev/sga

/dev/sga [=/dev/sda  bus1 ch=0 target=0 lun=0]
        /dev/sga
        Vendor = SEAGATE
        Product = ST39204LC
        Version = 0006
        Serial Number = 1BV031 M
        Copyright = Copyright (c) 2000 Seagate All rights reserved
        SCSI Firmware = 83473238
        Servo RAM Release = 83470818
        Servo ROM Release = 00000001
        Servo RAM Date = C21B
        Servo ROM Date = 1999

        Blocksize = 512, Highblock = 17921834, Capacity = 8961 MB
        -this is a Seagate drive
        -this drive supports DST
                -short DST time = 120 seconds
                -long DST time = 419 seconds
        -Mode Page Settings [current value (default)]:
                -WCE bit = 1 (1)
                -RCD bit = 0 (0)
                -AWRE bit = 1 (1)
                -ARRE bit = 1 (1)
                -DExcpt bit = 1 (0)
                -Number of cache segments = 16 (3)
                -PM  bit = 1 (0)

-------------------------------------------------------------
-I  displays drive Inquiry information for all SCSI devices

Using the same output structure as the -i option, the uppercase -I
provides details on all the SCSI devices in the system.  This is a
complete bus scan with details.  Each SCSI drives detected in the bus
scan will display the -i Inquiry information level of detail.

-------------------------------------------------------------
-t ###  execute ###% (10% - 100%) short Drive Self Test (DST)

Drive Self Test (DST) is a diagnostic technology within the drive
designed to recognize drive fault conditions.  DST validates the
functionality of the drive in background mode and will suspend self-
testing to service any other commands.  DST utilizes the SCSI Send
Diagnostic command in background mode.  The short test is 120 seconds
long and consists of a collection of factory test routines that have
the highest likelihood of detecting drive problems.  All tests are
safe to user data.

The short DST may be shortened by setting a lower test depth
percentage.  The 10% level is approximately 12 seconds long.  The
ability of the DST to detect problems is lessened by shortening the
test.  Therefore, this feature should be used more as a fast, good
health check when confidence in the drive is not an issue.

DST is a capability of drives manufactured after 1999.  If a DST -t
options is given to an older drive, the software will recognize the
situation and switch over to the -g generic legacy test.

If a drive fails testing, follow your system's authorized service
procedures.  It is possible for a drive to pass the short DST and fail
the long DST.  This is because not all sectors are read on the short
DST.  See the -T option for the long DST.

ex: st -t 10 /dev/sga   execute 10 % of the short Drive Self Test
(DST)

-------------------------------------------------------------
-T ###  execute ###% (10% - 100%) long Drive Self Test (DST)

The long DST reads every sector on the drive. The duration of the
complete test is based on the capacity of the drive.  Since the drive
reports its progress as a percentage of completion, the test may be
shortened by utilizing a lower percentage.

ex: st -T 20 /dev/sga   execute 20 % of the long Drive Self Test (DST)

-------------------------------------------------------------
-s  stop Drive Self Test (DST)

DST operates in a background mode.  It is sometimes necessary to halt
the test.  Since this command line utility will exit on ^C, the drive
could still be running its DST.  Generic tests end with ^C, DST tests
do not.  Use the -s to send the abort DST command.

ex: st -s /dev/sga   send abort DST command to /dev/sga.

-------------------------------------------------------------
-g ### execute ###% (1-% - 100%) generic short test for legacy & non-
Seagate drives

Similar to the -t option.  This short test option is approximately 120
seconds long and is used on older drives that do not support DST.
However, drives that do support DST may also run these tests.    All
tests are safe to user data.  All test commands are issued by the host
and operate in the foreground.  In this situation, the ability of the
drive to suspend testing in order to service other disc IO requests is
managed by the operating system.

ex: st -g 10 /dev/sga    execute 10 % of the short legacy test

-------------------------------------------------------------
-G  generic long test (sequential verify test of entire drive)

All sectors on the drive are verified from the outer diameter to the
inner diameter.

-------------------------------------------------------------
-r  generate Seagate RMA form

In the unlikely event of failure, SeaTools -r helps organize the model
and serial number information and basic removal instructions and
cautions into a simple text file named rmalog.txt.   You can verify
warranty status for distribution Seagate drives at www.seagate.com.
Drives that are part of an OEM system package are not supported on the
web site.  You will need to contact the system OEM for product return
instructions.

-------------------------------------------------------------
-v  show SeaTools version and license agreement

Please read the Right To Use License Agreement.  This option also
displays the SeaTools version number and the version number of the all
important SCSI "SG" driver.  SG driver versions need to be higher than
3xxxx to support the DST commands.  If SeaTools encounters a 2xxxx SG
driver, only generic legacy tests will operate.

=====================================================================

5. Advanced Options (many of these options are destructive to data)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Some of these functions, such as format, cause loss of data.  Other
functions should be used with caution.  Be sure to read and follow all
program instructions and cautions.  Backup all critical data files, if
possible, prior to running and Advance Options.  If you have any
questions about these option, contact Seagate technical support for
assistance.

-Marg Drive Preferences (mode page) change
Note: Use -i INQUIRY option to display the supported & current
settings.

This option gives you the ability to change several drive settings
that control the operation of the drive.

Performance Mode (PM)
        -Mpmon/off desktop/server PM bit
           On (Desktop Mode), PM indicates that the number of cache
           segments is fixed to the value set in Caching Page.  Off
           (Server Mode), PM indicates that the drive will optimize
           the number of segments depending on the command activity
           observed by the drive.  Not all SCSI drives support this
           feature.

Write Cache Enable (WCE)
        -Mwceon/off  set/clear WCE bit
           On, SCSI Write command may return as soon as data has been
           received from host.  Off, SCSI Write command may not return
           status until data has been written to media.

Read Cache Disable (RCD)
        -Mrcdon/off  set/clear RCD bit
           On, SCSI Read command must access the media.  Data cannot
           come from the cache.  Off, SCSI Read command may access the
           cache or the media.

Just In Time (JIT)
        -Mjitdefault set all JIT bits, factory default
        -Mjit1on set only JIT bit 1, clears any others
        -Mjit2on set only JIT bit 2, clears any others
           JIT (Just In Time) bits allow you to enable and disable
           certain seek speeds.  Slow, has the quietest audio
           operation with a reduction in performance.  This can also
           reduce power consumption (from seek activity).  Medium,
           allows all seek speeds and selects the quietest speed that
           doesn't hurt performance.  Fast, has the loudest audio
           operation but enhances performance speed.  Not all SCSI
           drives support this feature.

Automatic Write Reallocation Enable (AWRE)
        -Mawreon/off  enable/disable AWRE bit
           On, drive automatically relocates bad blocks detected
           during write operations.  Off, drive creates Check
           Condition status with sense key of Medium Error if bad
           blocks are detected during write operations.

Automatic Read Reallocation Enable (ARRE)
        -Marreon/off  enable/disable ARRE bit
           On, drive automatically relocates bad blocks detected
           during read operations.  Off, drive creates Check condition
           status with sense key of Medium Error if bad blocks are
           detected during read operations.

Disable Exception Control (DExcpt, SMART logging)
        -Mdexon/off  disable/enable DExcpt bit
           Sets operating mode of Self-Monitoring Analysis and
           Reporting Technology (SMART).  On, disables monitoring of
           the SMART failure prediction thresholds.  Off, enables
           monitoring of the SMART data for exceeded thresholds

Disable Loop Master (DLM, fibre channel only)
        -Mdlmon/off  disable/enable DLM bit
           On, target does not become loop master.  Off, target must
           wait to receive an Address or Port Discovery ELS.

Disable Target Oriented Loop Initialization  (DTOLI, fibre channel
only)
        -Mdtolion/off  disable/enable DTOLI bit
           On, target does not originate the initializing LIP
           following insertion into the loop.  Off, target originates
           the initializing LIP.

Number of Cache Segments
        -Mcache#  set # cache segments
           Allows the user to set the number of cache segments to the
           factory default or to a user specified number of cache
           segments.

           ex: st -Mcache8 /dev/sga set # of cache segments on
           /dev/sga to 8

-------------------------------------------------------------
-F  default low-level SCSI format

WARNING: Data loss will occur with this option.  Formatting ensures
that the medium is formatted so all of the user-addressable data
blocks can be accessed.  There is no guarantee that the medium has or
has not been altered.  In addition, the medium may be certified and
control structures may be created for the management of the medium and
defects.

It is possible to format the system boot drive.  Do not make the
mistake of formatting the wrong drive!  Be completely sure of what you
are doing before using the format command.

DATA ON THE SELECTED DEVICE WILL BE IRRETRIEVABLY LOST DURING
FORMATTING.

-------------------------------------------------------------
-d file  firmware download

This option allows you to select the downloaded firmware file from
your local disc drive and then upgrade the firmware on the currently
selected drive.

Firmware files for Seagate drives are only available from Seagate.
Seagate does not make firmware files available to the public.  In rare
cases, in the course of troubleshooting a specific drive problem,
Seagate technical support may offer different firmware as a solution.

DO NOT power down the server or the drive during this upgrade process.
If drive power is lost during a firmware upgrade, the drive will be
destroyed. Wait until all drive / LED activity has ceased before
powering off the drive. The upgrade process should not take more than
3 minutes per drive.

ex: st -d fwfile.sea /dev/sga  download firmware file fwfile.sea into
/dev/sga

-------------------------------------------------------------
-C ### capacity change

The drive's number of logical blocks (sectors, therefore capacity) may
be lowered for specific situations - such as matching mirrored drives.
The capacity can be set to a specific size smaller than maximum. Since
the numbering is zero based, 100 sectors would be entered as 99.  Use
the max argument to set the drive to factory maximum.

CAUTION: Data may be lost with this function.

ex: -C 1234567890 set high blocks to 1234567890 (zero based)
ex: -C max change capacity to factory maximum

-------------------------------------------------------------
-B ### sector (block) size change followed by a format

In almost all situations, sectors will be 512 bytes per sector.  Some
operating systems allow the use of non-512 byte sectors.  Not all
Seagate drives support non-512 byte formats.  The number of logical
block after format is a function of the block size.  A sector size of
1024 bytes will result in half as many logical blocks.  The total
capacity of the drive is still remain approximately the same.

WARNING: Data loss will occur with this option.  Formatting ensures
that the medium is formatted so all of the user-addressable data
blocks can be accessed.  There is no guarantee that the medium has or
has not been altered.  In addition, the medium may be certified and
control structures may be created for the management of the medium and
defects.

It is possible to format the system boot drive.  Do not make the
mistake of formatting the wrong drive!  Be completely sure of what you
are doing before using the sector (block) size change followed by a
format command.

DATA ON THE SELECTED DEVICE WILL BE IRRETRIEVABLY LOST DURING
FORMATTING.

ex: -B 1024 change to 1024 bytes/sector

=====================================================================

5. Troubleshooting
------------------
"bash: st254: command not found"
don't forget the add the ./ to the command: ./st254

Several FAQs for SCSI disc drive troubleshooting are available at
http://www.seagate.com/support/kb/disc/index_faq.html

If no drives are listed then confirm the SCSI/Fibre Channel host
adapter is configured and check that your hard drive is SCSI or Fibre
Channel. (ATA is not supported at this time.)

If your drive is still not displayed check that your SCSI cable is
tightly connected to the drive. Also try another power connector to
the drive (power down the system first).

If the drive is completely unresponsive, it will not be seen by the
computer.  Most SCSI host adapters post some information to the screen
during the boot process.  The information lists the drives that are
connected to the adapter(and operational.  If the drive you want to
test is not seen by the adapter, then the operating system and
software will not see the drive, either.

If the drive is listed several times confirm that the drive is not
sharing the same SCSI ID as another device. Most host adapters use ID
7 by default.

=====================================================================

6. SeaTools Diagnostic v2.54 KNOWN LIMITATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------
SeaTools relies on the SG driver for communication to the SCSI
devices.  The particular SCSI Send Diagnostic command which issues the
Drive Self Test (DST) is supported in Linux kernel versions after 2.4.
In the transition from earlier versions to 2.4, the SG driver, itself,
was updated from 2xxx to 3xxx.

If SeaTools is run on a down level system, SeaTools will see the 2xxx
SG driver and automatically switch to "generic" tests.  These tests
are intended to follow a test sequence which is similar to DST.

11. Product Return Procedure
----------------------------

Service by Seagate
------------------
A. Seagate Disc or Tape Drive Return Procedure
B. Shipping and Handling Information - Packaging Instructions
C. Seagate Approved Packaging
D. Limited Warranty
E. Service Warranty Terms


A. Seagate Disc or Tape Drive Return Procedure
----------------------------------------------
Seagate offers comprehensive worldwide customer support for all
Seagate disc and tape drives both online and through our regional
Seagate Customer Service Centers and Authorized Service Providers
(see "Seagate Technology Support Services" section, above). Drive
return procedures can vary by geographical location and are subject
to current International Trade Regulations.

1. Before you return a disc or tape drive for warranty service,
   verify whether a replacement drive is necessary to solve the
   problem you are experiencing. If so, contact your place of
   purchase; if they have an exchange policy, it may be your most
   convenient solution.

2. Read the appropriate Seagate Warranty Statement for new or
   replacement products (see "Service Warranty Terms" section, below).

3. Know your Seagate product model number and serial number.  Your
   PRINTME.TXT file has this information.  Otherwise, see the label
   on the top of the drive.

4. Verify the warranty status of the drive you wish to return. If
   the product is still under warranty, obtain an RMA (step 5). If
   the warranty is expired, contact a local service facility, a
   Seagate Service Center Representative, or an Authorized Service
   Provider. If Seagate records indicate that the warranty is
   expired and you believe this is incorrect, contact your place of
   purchase or a Seagate Service Center Representative.

5. Obtain an RMA. To obtain an RMA online, use the Warranty
   Validation application at
   www.seagate.com/support/supporttop.html. It will lead you into
   the RMA request application. As an alternative, you can email
   your PRINTME.TXT file to SeaToolsRMA@Seagate.com. To obtain an
   RMA by phone or fax, contact an Authorized Service Center (see
   "Seagate Technology Support Services" section above).

6. Obtain a "ship to" address. Service Centers are located
   throughout the world. The ship to address of the facility nearest
   you will be included with the RMA.

7. Package and return the drive. IMPROPER PACKAGING WILL VOID THE
   WARRANTY. Be sure to read the Shipping and Handling Information
   (below). Your original drive will NOT be returned to you, so be
   sure to backup any data you wish to keep and return only the bare
   drive. If you are unable to retrieve needed data, you may want to
   consider data recovery services.

Once Seagate Technology receives your drive for service, Seagate will
ship you a replacement drive. You may check the status of your
replacement drive RMA shipment online or by contacting a Seagate
Service Center Representative to obtain that information.


B. Shipping and Handling Information - Packaging Instructions
-------------------------------------------------------------
1. When you return a drive for replacement, all data and software
   will be lost. The replacement drive will be low-level formatted.
   If you need the data on the drive and do not have a backup copy,
   you may want to consider data recovery services before shipping
   the drive to Seagate for replacement.

2. Remove all accessories or spare parts and return only the bare
   drive! Accessories include, but are not limited to, side rails,
   manuals, removable media, cables, mounting brackets, face plates,
   and controller cards. Accessories will not be returned.

3. Enclose the drive in an anti-static container. If packaging more
   than one drive, use a separate bag for each drive.

4. Secure the drive in Seagate approved packaging. Use 2-inch thick
   foam rubber in a corrugated box. Multiple drives in a single box
   should be packaged with foam rubber between each drive. Do NOT
   use foam packing pellets, bubble wrap, or newspaper. (See Seagate
   Approved Packaging section, below.)

5. Write the RMA number on the outside of each box.

6. A shipping address will be given to you along with the RMA
   number. Ship the drive to the address provided using the carrier
   of your choice. You should choose a carrier with the ability to
   trace the shipment. Seagate Technology will not be responsible
   for shipments for which the carrier cannot provide proof of
   delivery.


C. Seagate Approved Packaging
-----------------------------
Shipping a drive in an unapproved container voids the warranty.  Any
product returned to Seagate must be properly packaged in the
original box or a Seagate-approved container to prevent physical and
electrical damage while in transit. FAILURE TO PROPERLY PACKAGE THE
DRIVE WILL VOID THE WARRANTY.

What is Seagate Approved Packaging?

   We recommend you ship your drive in its original box and packing
   materials, which you should always keep for storing and shipping
   purposes. If you do not have your original packaging materials,
   use 2-inch thick foam rubber in a corrugated box. Multiple drives
   in a single box should be packaged with foam rubber between each
   drive. Do NOT use foam packing pellets, bubble wrap, or newspaper.

Where can I get Seagate Approved Packaging?

   Seagate does not separately sell packaging materials. While
   Seagate does not endorse any one third party vendor, companies
   that provide packaging materials can be found at:

   Western Industries - For additional information, see
   https://www.wicokc.com/orderform/seagate.html

   SiongBee - For additional information, see
   https://www.siongbee.com/sgorder.nsf

and warranty information, please contact the respective vendor
directly.


D. Limited Drive Warranty ("Products")
--------------------------------------
Beginning on the date of shipment to its direct customer and
continuing for the published warranty period, Seagate represents
that the Products are new or, if they contain remanufactured or used
components, are the equivalent of new in performance and reliability

purchase or from Seagate prior to returning the nonconforming
Product freight prepaid. Seagate will pay for transporting the
repaired or exchanged Product to Customer. Repaired or exchanged
Product will be warranted for a period of one (1) year for Disc
Products and six (6) months for Tape Products from the date of
shipment by Seagate, or the remainder of the original warranty,
whichever is the longer. This Limited Warranty extends to Seagate's
direct customer only and is not assignable or transferable. Seagate
makes no representation, warranty or guaranty, express or implied
regarding the Products except its standard form of limited warranty
("Limited Warranty"). Seagate may in its sole discretion modify its
Limited Warranty at any time and from time to time.

DRIVE PRODUCT WARRANTY DISCLAIMER

MAKES NO PERFORMANCE REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR GUARANTEES,
EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN, WITH RESPECT TO ITS
PRODUCTS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY (A) OF

LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR OTHER
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE PURCHASE, USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE
PRODUCT, AND WHETHER OR NOT IT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE FOREGOING ALLOCATION OF RISK IS REFLECTED IN
THE PRICE OF THE PRODUCT.


E. Repair Warranty Terms
------------------------
All Seagate repaired disc products are warranted for one year or the
balance of your original warranty, whichever is greater. All Seagate
repaired tape products are warranted for six months or the balance
of your original warranty, whichever is greater. Customer shall be
responsible for saving or backing up data contained in any Product
returned to Seagate for in-warranty or out-of-warranty repairs or
service.

DISCLAIMER: SEAGATE SHALL HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR DATA AND SHALL
HAVE NO LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF ANY DAMAGE TO OR LOSS OF DATA WHILE
THE PRODUCT IS IN SEAGATE'S POSSESSION.

If you require assistance with data recovery, you may obtain
information about recovery services from the world wide web.
